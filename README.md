## EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
### Email spam detection is used to separate the spam and non-spam emails of a user. In this project I have used porter stemmer for text pre-processing and then used Multinomial Naive Bayes model to classify the spam and non-spam emails given in the dataset.
